# Email Feed
## This is a start of working on a email feed easing the viewing of email into a graphical interface and less click and more scrolling.
### How to setup

1. Install Outlook on your machine
2. I tested this with my live account it may work on other IMAP providers.
3. Run the powershell file getEmail.ps1
4. A file called index.html will be created and it will pull from the new created mailbox folder.
5. Open index.html this and scroll down to view all your emails.
6. For time being a gap on the right is provided for ease of scrolling.
